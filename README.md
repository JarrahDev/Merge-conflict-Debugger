# Merge-conflict-Debugger

`listener.py`

Description: This Python script serves as the listener component of your Git Bash terminal monitoring and conflict resolution application. It actively listens to the output of the Git Bash terminal, scans it for specific conditions or patterns (e.g., error messages), and takes appropriate actions based on what it detects.


`detector.py`

Description: This Python script serves as the detector component of your Git Bash terminal monitoring and conflict resolution application. It specializes in identifying merge conflicts within the terminal's output. When a conflict is detected, it provides the user with the option to open a text editor (e.g., Vim) to make decisions and resolve the conflicts, following the standard Git conflict resolution process.
